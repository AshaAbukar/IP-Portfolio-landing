        <h4>About me</h4>
        <p>Hello! My name is Asha but i prefer to be called Aisha, I'm an aspiring web developer.</p>
        <p>I graduated from <em>light international school</em>. I was taking information technology as a subject in high school and that is when my interest for computing began. I graduated with a <strong>distinction</strong> for my O-Level exams and a pass for my A-Levels. I enrolled at <em>strathmore university</em> pursuing <strong>Bachelor of Business and Information Technology</strong>. After being there for a semester i decided to discontinue with the program as i was not sure of what i really wanted plus i wasn't happy there. I began reading self-help books to help me understand more about my self, i soon developed an intrest for life coaching. I enrolled in a three month program to train as a life coach and became certified. I became more spritual and started taking religious classes.</p>
        <p>I met a freind who was studying overseas taking a course in computer science, she had told me how she loved her course and alot of intresting things. I was familiar with information technology but not computer science so i researched about it and became intrested in it. I enrolled at <a href="https://moringaschool.com/">moringa school</a> to learn about programming.</p>
        <p>My hobbies include but are not limited to riding bicycles, check out this webpage for more information on <a href="https://github.com/AshaAbukar/my-favoritethings">my favorite things</a></p>
